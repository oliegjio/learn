A pointer of type void represents the address of an object, but not it's type

Declaration of a variable/function simply declares that the variable/function exists somewhere in the program but the memory is not allocated for them. When we define a variable/function, it also allocates memory for that variable/function.

Variable or function can be declared any number of times, but can be defined only once.

Keyword "extern" used with variable definition declares the variable, but you will need to define it somewhere else, outside of this file.
Keyword "extern" expands visibility of variable to the whole program.

The expression sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes.

Angle brackets in include statements usually used for system headers. Quotes in include statements usually used for headers in the current working directory.
