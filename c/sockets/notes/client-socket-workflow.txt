Actually there is no such thing as `client` or `server` socket.
The socket is a two way waypoints: you can receive and send information on both ends.

- The client socket is created with socket() call.
- Connected to remote address with connect() call.
- And then can retrieve data with the recv() call.

socket() => connect() => recv().
